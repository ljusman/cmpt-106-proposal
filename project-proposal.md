#CMPT 106 Project Proposal

## Alpha Group
Mark Bahnman

###NAME OF GAME/PROJECT

Description of what project is

####Criteria
1. Game runs without any major bugs
2. Degree of game completion
3. Simple AI
4. Most, if not all bugs in the game are not present
5. Many members of the group are familiar with Python and Pygame by the end of the semester
6. etc etc


####Planning
*Assign what everyone does here. I can do whatever; I am confident in public speaking and writing if it is very technical (not an arts student). Honestly, 8 people programming would either lead to someone (me) not doing enough or something. Delete this paragraph when you're done assigning.

####Programs Used

* Someone please list all, if not most, of the programs we'll be using here.

####Organization
* Revising from anyone is welcome 
1.January 31st - February 7th, work on finalizing project proposal & core ideas
2. Feb 7th - 21st(?), have a clear understanding of pygame and python
3. Feb 21st(?) - Mar 29th, working on the game, take notes on important steps along the way
4. Mar 29 - end of semester, fixing & refining game, documentation
If game is finished early, bonus features will be implemented.
